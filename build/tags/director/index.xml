      <description>I am by no means an expert in OOP. I know how to use it and I know some of the concepts but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell you anything about polymorphism or abstraction but I know that I use them. Way back in the olden days when I was writing Director code in Lingo I wrote my projects almost exclusively using objects. In fact I doubt that I could have written a project without using objects of some type since it became a fundamental of my coding style and my workflow.</description>

      <description>One side-effect of looking back at your previous work is that you get a bit misty-eyed for your glory years. I am as prone as anyone to look back and only see the good memories but I think that I was quite lucky to have gotten into multimedia development when I did. The people that were using Director to make applications, tools, educational content and games were an odd mix. They were not comp-sci folks.</description>
