      <description>Sometimes you just have to say Shut it down! and move on.
I spent the better part of the week working on creating a browser for the modding commands for Conquest of Elysium 5. I had the data for the commands built into a nested JSON file. I built a template for JSRender that took the data and created a collapsible tree menu that let you browse the command structure and then view individual commands.</description>

      <description>My new project has a lot of text data that is available in a .csv and spreadsheet files but not in any more useful format. I took the .csv data I had an created a sqllite .db file so I could use it to generate some queries to create a .json file which I will use to display the data but also to create the menu system.
The original data is the modding documentation for a game.</description>
