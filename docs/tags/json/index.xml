      <description>So I have been working with various command line tools and apps to try to build a workflow to let me take csv data that I export from a spreadsheet and turn it into JSON. This actually isn&amp;rsquo;t too difficult and there are a lot of tools, like Miller, that will let you take csv and monkey with it. It has a lot of options but many of them seem to be tools to work with CSV, or similar, data and not a lot of them seem to be options for JSON.</description>

      <description>The problem of serializing data and then importing it back into your application is very, very old. I remember Andy White and a few others discussing approaches to this in Director twenty years ago. Andy came up with some code that could do it in Lingo and then XML became a thing1 and we all started using XML for serializing data. Andy, being Andy, came out with a better, and faster, XML parser than Macromedia did.</description>
