      <description>Sometimes you just have to say Shut it down! and move on.
I spent the better part of the week working on creating a browser for the modding commands for Conquest of Elysium 5. I had the data for the commands built into a nested JSON file. I built a template for JSRender that took the data and created a collapsible tree menu that let you browse the command structure and then view individual commands.</description>

      <description>My new project has a lot of text data that is available in a .csv and spreadsheet files but not in any more useful format. I took the .csv data I had an created a sqllite .db file so I could use it to generate some queries to create a .json file which I will use to display the data but also to create the menu system.
The original data is the modding documentation for a game.</description>

      <description>Well it has been a busy week. Lets have a look back at all of the new things I have &amp;lsquo;learned&amp;rsquo;1 in order to get my web application up and running.
JSRender and JSView So the biggest thing for me was learning to integrate JSRender and JSView into my web application. I can&amp;rsquo;t get over how well they work and also how easy they were to use. I am not really stressing either library but I took the HTML creation for a fairly complex display and turned it into a template and took the code needed to create it into one line.</description>

      <title>The Speed of Javascript</title>

      <description>I still have difficulty comprehending the speed at which Javascript runs in the browser. Part of the speed is due to the processors that our computers are running. A more significant amount of the improvement though is the capabilities of the Javascript engines that are being used in browsers as well as the advent of JIT in those engines.
It has dramatically changed not only what you can do in a web-based application but how you do it.</description>
