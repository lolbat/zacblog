      <description>Well it has been a busy week. Lets have a look back at all of the new things I have &amp;lsquo;learned&amp;rsquo;1 in order to get my web application up and running.
JSRender and JSView So the biggest thing for me was learning to integrate JSRender and JSView into my web application. I can&amp;rsquo;t get over how well they work and also how easy they were to use. I am not really stressing either library but I took the HTML creation for a fairly complex display and turned it into a template and took the code needed to create it into one line.</description>
