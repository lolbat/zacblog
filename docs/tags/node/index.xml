      <description>So I didn&amp;rsquo;t wait to get other work done and went ahead and built the shell script to automate converting all of my csv files. I did a few stackoverflow searches to find some information about getting filenames into a shell script and then iterating over them. I also had to look up how to determine the filename without the extension as I had to create a new .json filename for the output file.</description>

      <description>I finally managed to finish my csv to JSON workflow. I originally tried usingMiller to export my csv to JSON but it didn&amp;rsquo;t provide all of the options that I needed. I managed to find a node library called csvtojson that had all of the tools I needed. It also lets you edit the header names to create nested JSON data in a way that I needed as well. I will be keeping Miller handy though as I will have more csv work to do in the future.</description>

      <title>Using Node to build CLI tools</title>

      <description>So I have been working with various command line tools and apps to try to build a workflow to let me take csv data that I export from a spreadsheet and turn it into JSON. This actually isn&amp;rsquo;t too difficult and there are a lot of tools, like Miller, that will let you take csv and monkey with it. It has a lot of options but many of them seem to be tools to work with CSV, or similar, data and not a lot of them seem to be options for JSON.</description>
