One side-effect of looking back at your previous work is that you get a bit misty-eyed for your glory years. I am as prone as anyone to look back and only see the good memories but I think that I was quite lucky to have gotten into multimedia development when I did. The people that were using Director to make applications, tools, educational content and games were an odd mix. They were not comp-sci folks. Even the really geeky coders like Andy White, Warren Ockrassa, Will Turnage, James Newton and Peter Small were polymaths who became exceptional coders because of their desire to explore and learn.

Heck, Peter Small, the person who [literally wrote the book][alifelink] on doing OOP programming in Director and opened up the concept of OOP to so many Lingo programmers, started out as an engineer who developed an interest in biology that then lead him to OOP programming for Director. There were entire projects that were developed in Director that wouldn't have existed if not for Peter Small.

Hanging out with those folks online or in real-life was always a joy because the conversations were almost never about Director and programming but often came back to it and then branched off to other things. I learned a lot about programming from people whose main interest was art or linguistics. It was heady and exhilarating. 

I was also young and single and didn't have a house or a mortgage and so I was able to do things that I couldn't possibly do now. And that is really a large component of the wistful nature of reminiscence. We compare our current selves to that younger more vibrant memory and it is never a happy process. We remember the energy and the activity and we don't recall the cramped apartments and the perilous financial situations. We built amazing things but we also spent hours grinding away in offices to do so. 

It is nice though that some of that content and work still remain. One peril of working in a purely digital environment is that it is often easy to lose your work. A server goes down and all your writing disappears. You lose the install disks for an app and you can't go back to load an old project. Your hardware can't run the OS that the old software requires and so projects bitrot and you can't access them anymore. The memories are always there though just as long as you take care to not let them trick you into thinking the past was as rose coloured as it looks now.
