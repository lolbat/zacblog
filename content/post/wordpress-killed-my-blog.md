I used to post a lot of content in [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/). I also spent a lot of time using it as a CMS template for custom websites that required content editing features. Wordpress was fairly simple to use and it was also easy to extend either with plugins or by writing your own PHP code.

Once I stopped developing websites as part of my business, I started using Wordpress as a blogging medium. I self-hosted several blogs and I also ran a small news website for a few years using Wordpress. The first post on my Wordpress hobby blog is from July 7th, 2004 and I posted on that blog, on and off, until July 6th 2021. So a day shy of 17 years. 

There are two reasons why I stopped blogging. One is because of the changing landscape of the internet and the other is because of the changing focus of  [Automattic](https://automattic.com) the company that maintains Wordpress. 

### The changing nature of the web

When I first started blogging the internet was just exiting its first period of consumer consolidation. [AOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL) (which still [appears to be a thing](https://www.aol.com/) even if it has been forced to get [a Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/aol)) and [Compuserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompuServe) had been shedding users as people found that they could get cheaper access to information with their own dialup access. 

My blog was initially a way to keep track of my hobby and also to have other enthusiasts provide feedback and comments. It was easier than posting information on multiple hobby forums and, for myself at least, it seemed to help foster a sense of local and international community. The thing that the web was supposed to be about. My blog generated a moderate amount of traffic and I had an RSS reader full of feeds from other blogs that I would read on a daily basis.

To say that things have changed dramatically is to stretch the meaning of the word beyond comprehension. Blogging without a link to a social media platform, almost specifically Facebook, is like shouting down a well. And to make matters worse, Facebook removed the ability to post to personal pages from an external source like Facebook so if you wanted to post links to your blog on Facebook you had to create a Page for the blog. 

People talk about *sea change* but the impact of Facebook on the wider web has been more of an extinction-level event. For all intents and purposes the internet is Facebook for everyone other than publishers or businesses large enough, or popular enough, to be able to draw an audience on their own. 

Instead of broadcasting to the world with your blog you now have an ever-diminishing audience that you have to share with content mills and SEO scammers. Now this in and of itself wouldn't be enough to kill my blog as I am stubborn enough to stick it out despite that but Wordpress itself drove the final nail in.

### The Block Editor is your friend

I am not sure exactly when it happened but at some point Automattic flipped a switch and the default writing tool for Wordpress changed from a fairly standard web interface into what they call the [Block Editor](https://wordpress.com/support/replacing-the-older-wordpress-com-editor-with-the-wordpress-block-editor/). 

It is a tool for creating 'content-rich blogs' which I have to assume is code for 'people who sell things'. If you just want to write a post it is an inconvenient tool that gets in the way of writing more than it helps it. 

Even the way that Automattic writes about the editor seems to be dismissive of people's complaints about it.

> Technology is always updating. The [Block Editor](https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/) takes advantage of the latest technology to help you build media-rich, mobile responsive, and unique websites.

But what if I don't want to build a 'media-rich, mobile responsive, and unique website'? What if I just want to write on my blog?

> It is entirely understandable that after years of using a specific workflow to create your content, a completely different editing experience can be very disruptive. The Block Editor first launched in December 2018, and we have been iterating on feedback from people using it ever since. 

This is a wonderful response because it seems to try to deflect the problem back to the user. Automattic has been responding to feedback about the Block Editor so what is your problem you luddite? And if the issue is understandable then why not let people select their own editor?

Now if I wanted to self-host my blog I could get any number of plugins that would re-enable the 'Classic Editor' by default. And I can also use the Classic Editor but in order to do so I have to also re-enable the 'classic' list view for posts so that I can see the option to use the older editor as well.

I looked at using a blogging tool to send posts to Wordpress. [MarsEdit](https://redsweater.com/marsedit/), from Red Sweater is a great tool but $50 USD is difficult to justify the cost for the occasional post to a hobby blog. When I was actively using Wordpress to run a news site, MarsEdit was an automatic purchase. 

I tried to adapt to the new editor but I found that I either wrote short posts or I posted less frequently. It just wasn't any fun to write with the Block Editor. Basic tasks like formatting were a chore and the tool created some [absolutely ugly HTML code](https://zacgaming.wordpress.com/2020/05/24/horrible-wordpress-html/) that was often a total PITA to edit. 

But apparently I could easily make a 'media-rich, mobile responsive, and unique website'. 

Automattic really can't be blamed for chasing the larger market for their tools. It seems that most people using blogging software these days are selling something. And those folks don't seem to be the type to want to write a few thousand words on a topic and quickly style some text. They want product shots that wrap around their commentary and looks good on a phone. I just wanted to be able to change a line to a heading without having to go through three or four steps.

Where I think Automattic is to blame is forcing their existing users to adapt to a content environment that isn't aimed at them. Want to give SEO hustlers the tools they want to make quick SEO friendly pages that still look good on a phone? Go ahead. There appears to be no reason to make me use the same interface unless I want to.

### 1 + 1 ==  'fuck it'

I could handle the diminished audience. I could even handle the Block Editor if I had to. Both though? That is just a one-two combination that is difficult to come back from. Now clearly I am still blogging. And I am clearly not bothered by these posts being shouts in the dark. What makes the difference is that I can write these posts in Markdown in an editor that supports the format fully and easily put the posts onto a site. My workflow is decided by how I want to write not by someone else making a decision about what tools they think I should use. 

Wordpress won't miss me. Facebook doesn't need my content but sometimes it is nice to be able to take your thoughts, arrange them in a pleasing fashion and put them out for the world to see. If it is still there.
