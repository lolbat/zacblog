A few days ago I was searching for information about the [Astro SSG](https://astro.build). I wanted to see if it was possible to use Astro to create a blog without too much fuss. I ultimately decided that it wasn't worth the effort given than [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is working well for me and I am only searching for a new SSG because I would rather work in Javascript.  

One of the results I found was Chris Coyier's article on CSS-Tricks about [getting started with Astro](https://css-tricks.com/a-look-at-building-with-astro/). Except it wasn't on CSS-Tricks. It was posted to two different sites that made some small changes to the text to, I assume, make it hash differently than the original but in both cases was presented as their own content.

I contacted the fine folks at [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) and they were aware of the links or at least familiar with the issue. I assumed that they were but I wanted to do the responsible thing and report it incase they were trying to police that sort of thing.

Now I am aware that this isn't a new issue but it is surprising just how much content online appears to be plagiarised. I am also surprised just how little Google seems to care about this issue.  Clearly Google doesn't care about this sort of thing as long as their ad money keeps coming in and they keep getting ad impressions. Your content, I imagine the suits at Google will say, is your problem.

But is it?

Google is an advertising company but one of the drivers of their ad business is search. We know this because you don't hand out big cheques to be the default search engine on browsers if search isn't a significant driver of your income. Plagarism like this taints search results and it pushes users away from search to find other solutions for getting information. 

These solutions don't exist yet but I don't think that the current situation needs to get much worse before some smart folks decide to fix the situation. What makes this an interesting situation is that the 'scale' needed to solve this issue and distribute a solution exists in ways that it didn't even a few years ago. 

Or maybe someone thinks up a solution that just cuts Google search out of the equation? 

There are a lot of possible vectors that a solution to a problem like this can take, a lot of smart people in the world and now a number of technological tools that make providing and scaling a solution possible.
