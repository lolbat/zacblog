So that was an interesting few months.

I was diagnosed with ADHD some time ago and during a checkup I mentioned that I had been grinding my teeth. It is, I assume, a fairly common side-effect of taking Dexedrine. This makes sense since it [is an amphetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine). Now I had just mentioned the teeth grinding as an aside. They had asked me about other symptoms and I said 'Well I'm grinding my teeth a lot' and the next thing I know I am trying a new drug.

It didn't work.

The thing is though that you have to try the drug for a while before people are satisfied that it doesn't work. So I went through about a month of feeling like my brain had been packed in fruit syrup to preserve freshness before I switched back to the Dexedrine. Frankly I'd rather grind my teeth to nubs than feel like that again.

My brain started working again almost immediately. And I am chewing a lot of gum. 

### Lets get coding!

One of the first things I did was finish up some work on [a small web application](https://coe5alamanc.netlify.app) I was writing. I'll talk about the changes in another post but I had been sitting on the project for a long time while my brain was getting rewired. I was so absentminded under the new medication that I actually pushed changes to the repository for the app twice before remembering that I was in the middle of changes and it wouldn't work. 

Yay modern medicine. 

So it works now and I will be working on getting more content for the app in the next few weeks.

### A mind is a terrible thing to waste

Now I say that it was a few months but even after the medication change I still wasn't back to 100% (whatever that means now) right away and it has only been in the last few weeks that I felt like doing any work.  

The first thing I did was move this blog to Netlify. Github Pages was working but I really didn't want to piss around figuring out how to build a Github Action to automate the building of this blog. Netlify has an, as close to zero as you can get, zero-step build process for Hugo and other SSGs so I decided to move the site there. Now I just update the Github repository and walk away. 

So hopefully this blog will see some more posts and I will start to get some more work done.
