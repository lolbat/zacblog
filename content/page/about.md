So what is this blog all about?

### The author
Zac is a recovering multimedia and web application developer. He started writing code and building applications before there even was a Javascript. Or a web. He feels very old writing that.

The first language he used was 6502 assembly code on an Apple II+ that he borrowed from his neighbour. After that he started using Pascal on his college's mainframe system. He took a hiatus away from computers and programming while he pursued a degree in history and linguistics.

Soon after, finding that there wasn't a lot of work for people with history BAs he started doing design work. How he found himself working as a designer with no experience is another story. A few years of design work lead to opportunities in the developing field of multimedia where he suddenly found himself coding again. This time the language was Lingo which was used in Macromedia Director. 

The CD-ROM and multimedia market took a fairly big crash but it was at the same time that the internet was starting to get a lot of attention from people with more money than brains. Amazing websites were built, exploded in popularity with investors, bought Super Bowl ads and then crashed. While all that was happening Zac was building content management systems with ColdFusion. 

An inconvenient RSI took him out of the programming game for a while and Zac went back to freelancing and continued to create websites in PHP (*ugh*) and HTML. Then along came an interesting CMS called Wordpress and he was happy building websites using it. Even if it meant that he had to write PHP code. Along the way he even took time to write an online video editor for an educational company.

He took more than a decade off to help take care of a set of delightful twins.

The twins are now in their teenage years and more than capable of taking care of themselves and so Zac has found that he has more time on his hands and has decided to figure out how the world of web application development works now.

Needless to say it is *very* different than it used to be.

The last time he checked out Javascript development before he took a hiatus REST wasn't even a thing. And so this blog is here to document his path into the world of git, node, Vue and a veritable avalanche of technologies that are new and wildly unfamiliar.
